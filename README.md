## My process

I have built the layout using grid and used flexbox for smaller stuff. The 2 column grid container contains three grid-items with class names item-a, item-b and, item-c with item-a getting full width of the grid container. Made the grid 1 column for devices with width less than 800px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project is useful to practice css grid.
